                            ever-present pipe in his mouth. He is always ready for a fight instead of a reasonable
                            discussion,
                            has a gravelly voice,
                            and is constantly mumbling under his breath. His credo is “I yam what I yam, and that’s all
                            what
                            I
                            yam.” His girlfriend
                            is the gangly, uncoordinated Olive Oyl, for whose attention Popeye vies constantly with
                            Bluto,
                            his
                            bearded, hulking
                            rival.</p>
